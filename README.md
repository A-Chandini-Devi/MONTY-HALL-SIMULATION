# MONTY-HALL-SIMULATION
Python - Mini Project - A brain teaser probability puzzle

The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975. It became famous as a question from reader Craig F. Whitaker's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990:

>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the >doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

</p>

 
Savant suggested that a contestant should switch to the other door to win a car, which has a 2/3 probability of winning under standard assumptions. This probability remains unchanged after the host reveals a goat behind one of the unchosen doors. The probabilities depend on specific assumptions about how the host and contestant choose their doors. Under these conditions, there is more information about doors 2 and 3 than when door 1 was chosen. Switching doors is different from choosing between two remaining doors at random, as the former uses previous information. Despite explanations, simulations, and formal mathematical proofs, many people still rejected her explanation. The Monty Hall problem is a veridical paradox, related to the Three Prisoners problem and Bertrand's box paradox.

EXPLANATION:
Then the possible outcomes can be seen in this table:

</p>

In two out of three cases, changing your selection after one door is revealed increases your chances of winning. This is because there is a higher probability of choosing a door with a goat behind it in the first go, and Monty is guaranteed to reveal another door with a goat behind it.

</p>

SOLUTION:
The solution is that switching will let you win twice as often as sticking with the original choice, a result that seems counterintuitive to many. The Monty Hall problem famously embarrassed a large number of mathematicians with doctorate degrees when they attempted to "correct" Marilyn vos Savant's solution in a column in Parade Magazine.
