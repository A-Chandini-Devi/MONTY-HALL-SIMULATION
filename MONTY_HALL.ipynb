Thus, achieving the random puzzle criteria with the Random function in Python. From the above examples, we can see that even when the code is executed, it can be either placed behind a different door or the same door it was placed before, which ensures the maximum randomness of this puzzle, making it a suitable game for a brain teaser game."
